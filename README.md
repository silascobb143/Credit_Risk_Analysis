# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
We were tasked to use the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, to oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, we used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, we compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Then we evaluated the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

Results:
* Naive Random Oversampling
In this sampling we got the Balanced accuracy score of 0.654047.

* SMOTE Oversampling
* Undersampling
* Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
* Balanced Random Forest
* Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
